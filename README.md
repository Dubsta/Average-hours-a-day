# Average-hours-a-day
Input total hours and find out your average hours per day for the year.

I wrote this little C program for the practice as well as something I acctually want to use.

One feature is that given a input of a hours, the program output the average in hours and minutes rounded to the closest minute.

I have had trouble understanding the time.h standard library in C, so this mini project was good to work things out.
I learnt that the library has types and structs declared in it, and you can use some of the functions to interact with them.
